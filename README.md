# Magento Coding Standard

A set of Magento rules for [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) tool.

#### Installation within a Magento 2 site
To use within your Magento 2 project you can use:
````
composer require --dev magento/magento-coding-standard
````
Due to security, when installed this way the Magento standard for phpcs cannot be added automatically.
You can achieve this by adding the following to your project's `composer.json`:
````
"scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd": "vendor/bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths ../../magento/magento-coding-standard/",
    "post-update-cmd": "vendor/bin/phpcs --config-set installed_paths ../../magento/magento-coding-standard/"
}
````

### Installation for development
You can install Magento Coding Standard by cloning this GitHub repo
```
$ git clone git@github.com:magento/magento-coding-standard.git
$ cd magento-coding-standard
$ composer install
```
It is possible also to install a standalone application via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
```
$ composer create-project magento/magento-coding-standard --stability=dev magento-coding-standard
```
